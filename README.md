## General considerations üìñ

### Calendar Component

- The calendar view is Monthly.
- When the project is start-up, the calendar for the current month is displayed.
- Leave some reminders in the global state so that they are displayed as an example, when it just starts.
- Weekend days (cells) are shown in a darker gray color and weekdays in a lighter color.
- The days (numbers) corresponding to the previous month or the following month are shown in a lighter gray and the days of the month in which you are unemployed in black.
- The current day (number) is displayed with a green background.
- Today button: shows you the calendar for the current month.
- Previous month/Next month button: changes the calendar view according to the selected month.
- Previous Year/Next Year button: changes the calendar view to the selected year (taking into account the month in which you are stopped).
- When the Next Month button reaches the last month, if clicked, it moves to the first month of the following year.
- When the Previous Month button reaches the first month, if clicked, it goes to the last month of the previous year.
- Reminders are displayed in a cell corresponding to their date, and if there is more than one for that day, they are grouped.
- The reminders in the calendar show the title, the city and the weather information.
- When clicking on a cell corresponding to a day, the popup opens to register a new reminder. By default the date field is set to the value of the selected day.
- When clicking on a cell corresponding to a reminder, the popup opens to edit it and the different fields are autocompleted.

### Reminder Component

- By clicking on the save button in the pop up, a new reminder is added or the selected one is updated. It is validated that you have completed all the fields. All values ‚Äã‚Äãof the reminders can be changed.
- When clicking on the cancel button of the pop up, it closes and has no functionality.
- By default, the 'Information weather' label is shown without any value or with the information of the selected reminder.
- After completing the city by clicking on the search button, it searches the current weather information for that city, using an OpenWeatherMap api.
- If a city is not completed, when clicking on the search button, the api will throw an error, and therefore the corresponding label is not updated (it is controlled with a try catch, but do not develop the logic that this is mandatory).

### General Info

- The view of the calendar and the PopUp to add/edit reminders adapt to different screen resolutions.
